What is a Callback in JavaScript?
A callback function is a function passed as an argument 
to another function. The function receiving the callback can execute it later.

Why Use Callbacks?
Asynchronous Operations: Callbacks are 
commonly used in asynchronous JavaScript (e.g., handling API requests, reading files, or timers).
Event Handling: Used in DOM event listeners.
Code Reusability: Allows passing different functions dynamically.
